## Files Updated

### 3. **job-status-update Template** âœ…

â”œâ”€â”€ Candidate: Jane Smith
â””â”€â”€ Location: New York, NY
```

### 4. **Frontend Integration** âœ…

**File:** `src/components/admin/DocumentUploader.tsx`

**Changes:**

- When admin uploads candidate, passes to `notify-client`:
  - `candidateLocation`: From parsed resume OR job posting location
  - `candidatePosition`: Job title from selected job post

**Code:**

```typescript
candidateLocation: formData.location || selectedJob?.location || null,
candidatePosition: selectedJob?.title || null,
```

### 5. **CandidateInfo Component** âœ…

**File:** `src/components/dashboard/CandidateInfo.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Updated candidate query to include `location` and job_posts.location
- Passes location to job status update email:
  - Tries candidate's location first
  - Falls back to job posting location

**Code:**

```typescript
candidateLocation: candidateData.location || candidateData.job_posts?.location || null,
```

## Email Templates Updated

### ðŸ“§ New Candidate Match Email

**Trigger:** When admin assigns candidate to client  
**Recipient:** Client  
**Includes:** Position âœ…, Location âœ…

### ðŸ“§ Reminder Email

**Trigger:** 24 hours after initial email if not opened  
**Recipient:** Client  
**Includes:** Position âœ…, Location âœ…

### ðŸ“§ Job Status Update Email

**Trigger:** When candidate status changes (hired/interviewing/not_hired)  
**Recipients:** Admin, configured email alerts  
**Includes:** Location âœ… (Position is the job title itself)

## Database Migrations Required

Run these migrations in order:

```bash
# 1. Add location and job_post_id to candidates table
supabase/migrations/20251016000000_add_job_post_and_location_to_candidates.sql

# 2. Update email reminder function to include position and location
supabase/migrations/20251016000001_update_email_reminder_with_position_location.sql
```

## Visual Improvements

**Position** - Displayed in **blue** (#2563eb) to stand out  
**Location** - Displayed in muted gray (#64748b) for context

Both fields are optional and only display if data is available.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Admin uploads resume with location
- [ ] Admin selects client and job position
- [ ] Client receives email with position and location
- [ ] If reminder sent after 24hrs, includes position and location
- [ ] When candidate hired, status update email includes location
- [ ] All fields gracefully handle missing data (don't show if null)

## Benefits

1. **Better Context:** Clients immediately see which position the candidate is for
2. **Location Awareness:** Clients know where the candidate is located
3. **Reduced Confusion:** Clear which job posting the candidate matches
4. **Professional:** Complete information in one email
5. **Consistency:** Same info across all email types

## Notes

- Location is extracted from resume during PDF parsing
- If resume parsing doesn't capture location, falls back to job posting location
- Position is always the job title from the selected job post
- All fields are optional - emails won't break if data is missing
- Email templates use conditional rendering to only show available data

## Future Enhancements

1. Add location matching/filtering in emails
2. Show distance between candidate and job location
3. Include salary information from job posting
4. Add job type (remote, hybrid, onsite) to emails
